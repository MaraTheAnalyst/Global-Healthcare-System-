# Global-Healthcare-System-

## Project Overview
This project examines global healthcare data to uncover how healthcare system structure, resource allocation, spending, and emergency response impact key health outcomes such as life expectancy, infant mortality, and patient satisfaction.

Using Python for statistical analysis and correlation testing, alongside Power BI for interactive visualization, the project transforms complex data into a clear, actionable dashboard that highlights the drivers of healthcare performance across countries and system types. The dataset focuses on worldwide healthcare systems, with insights relevant to global health organizations such as the UN, WHO, and UNICEF. The goal is to not only compare healthcare outcomes but also identify the factors shaping them.

### Tools Used
- Python: data cleaning, validation, statistical testing, and correlation analysis
- Power BI: interactive data visualization and dashboard development

### Key Indicators Analyzed
- Life expectancy
- Infant mortality rate
- Patient satisfaction
- Healthcare expenditure

### Healthcare Capacity Drivers Explored
- Doctor availability
- Hospital bed capacity
- Emergency response time

The resulting dashboard provides a data-driven evaluation of healthcare system performance while offering evidence-based explanations for the differences observed across countries.
